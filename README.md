# PresenceHub

PresenceHub is a modular Discord Rich Presence client for Android.

Instead of hardcoding support for YouTube, Spotify, Twitch, and every other platform into one massive app, PresenceHub works through plugins.

Each plugin is responsible for detecting activity, handling authentication, and generating Rich Presence information.

The main application simply manages plugins and communicates with Discord.
